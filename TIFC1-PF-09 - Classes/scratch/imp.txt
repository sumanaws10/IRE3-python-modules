The self parameter is a reference to the instance itself
self is my_cat
my_cat is self argument effectively
when you call class you never had to pass argument from self
The self Parameter
The self parameter is a reference to the instance itself; This is a litle confusing, but the point of classes is to make objects -
and each object needs to be unique. Imagine you're making a game, and your class creates enemies. 
 Each enemy might start the same, but they each need their own health bar, perhaps you want them to be different colours.
So self gives each individual instance access to it's own set of attributes, and allows each instance to access the methods from 
  within the class individually. 
  So, if you give your enemies a method allowing them to dodge out of your way, they won't all have to dodge at the same time.
  ##########
one more point about self, if you think back to the Functions module, you may remember that if a function requires parameters,
we pass arguments through to them when we call the function. However, when we create an instance of a class, we don't need to provide
    an argument for Self.

    what super function does:
    
The super() function helps Python make connections between a parent and a child class, and the __init__ method
 takes in information required to make a Cat instance.
